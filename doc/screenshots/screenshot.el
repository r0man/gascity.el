;;; screenshot.el --- Reusable Emacs GUI screenshot engine -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-

;; Copyright (C) 2026

;;; Commentary:

;; A small, package-agnostic engine for capturing high-resolution PNG
;; screenshots of Emacs UI buffers from a batchy, scripted GUI session.
;; It is the reusable half of the gascity.el documentation screenshot
;; pipeline; a sibling package (e.g. beads.el) reuses it verbatim by
;; providing its own load path, theme, and shot list (see the README in
;; this directory).
;;
;; The engine deliberately knows nothing about gascity: a caller sets the
;; configuration variables below, calls `screenshot-init' once to load a
;; theme and strip the frame chrome, then `screenshot-run' with a list of
;; shots.  Each shot opens a view and the engine fits the frame to the
;; rendered content and exports it with `x-export-frames'.
;;
;; Determinism: many porcelain views fetch their data asynchronously, so
;; `screenshot-settle' pumps the event loop until no live process matches
;; `screenshot-async-process-regexp' (or a fixed budget elapses).  The
;; caller sets that regexp to its async process name (gascity uses
;; "gascity-gc").
;;
;; This file must run in a *graphical* Emacs (not --batch): `x-export-frames'
;; needs a real frame.  The frame may live on a private headless Wayland
;; compositor so nothing pops onto the user's desktop (see capture.sh).
